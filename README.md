a# Airpods connection for linux

Firstly, you should put mac of your device in bash script

Secondly, run this script with this command:

```
./connect_airpods
```

Or you may use an alias for a convenient connection of your device

Open your airpods while script is runnin and enjoy

Also, I may try to implement this script into Electron application, so that you are going to have a beautiful animation of your airpods just like on the IPhone or Mac. 

Will use Webapi
